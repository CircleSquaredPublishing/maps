Belgo is noted for its arresting 1990s design and architecture, including kitchens viewable by customers entering the restaurant (Noord and Centraal) and its waiters and waitresses, who dress as monks. Anand Zenz was the designer-architect responsible for the main space and the furniture and fittings at Chalk Farm (Noord, 1992), with Ron Arad taking over as architect-designer for the extension to Noord (1994) and the 13,000sqft Belgo Centraal, voted London Restaurant of the Year in 1996.There are five Belgo restaurants: Belgo Centraal, on Earlham Street, Covent Garden, Belgo Noord on Chalk Farm Road, the two former Bierodromes on Clapham High Street and Kingsway, and Belgo Bromley in the Glades shopping centre in Bromley which opened in March 2010.HistoryBelgo was founded in 1992 by French-Canadian Denis Blais and Anglo-Belgian Andre Plisnier. The brand was expanded to a chain of bar diners known as Bierodrome in Clapham and Kingsway (and Islington, and Belgo Zuid (124 Ladbroke Grove), both now closed) but those remaining open all now trade in the Belgo format.Belgo was bought in 1998 by ex-fund manager, newspaper columnist and ex-Chairman of Channel 4 Luke Johnson, known for his financial stewardship, with colleague Hugh Osmond, of the Pizza Express chain of pizza restaurants in the 1990s. However, attempts to extend the Belgo franchise organically beyond London in the late 1990s were not successful: the franchise in Jersey lasted barely 12 months before closing in 2000 and, in any event, the Belgo flotation was used as a vehicle to acquire a number of celebrated chic London restaurants, such as The Ivy, The Caprice, Daphne's The Collection and J.Sheekey, creating the 'Signature Restaurants' division and a business with a market capital that peaked at more than \u00a390,000,000.","website":"http:\/\/www.belgo-restaurants.co.uk\/","id":"110532835634775"},{"location":{"street":"King's Cross \/ Monument \/ Blackfriars \/ Bankside","city":"London","state":"","country":"United Kingdom","zip":"N1 9FD \/ EC3R 7BD \/ EC4V 6EP \/ SE1 9NA","latitude":51.5303307,"longitude":-0.12328},"name":"Camino","likes":5512,"talking_about_count":134,"were_here_count":0,"description":"You can find us at the following locations\nKing's Cross - 3 Varnishers Yard, The Regents Quarter, N1 9NL\nMonument -14 Mincing Lane, EC3R 7BD\nBlackfriars - 33 Blackfriars Lane, EC4V 6EP\nBankside- 5 Canvey Street, SE1 9NA\n","website":"http:\/\/www.camino.uk.com","cover":{"cover_id":"10153261773147462","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xta1\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/12094972_10153261773147462_6793352043583146808_o.jpg","offset_y":20,"offset_x":0},"about":"Award-winning wine, jam\u00f3n, tapas & huge gin-tonics in Bankside, King's Cross, Blackfriars & Monument.

It is an irregular block of oolitic limestone measuring 53 \u00d7 43 \u00d7 30\u00a0cm (21 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 12\"), the remnant of a once much larger object that had stood for many centuries on the south side of the street.The name \"London Stone\" was first recorded around the year 1100. The date and original purpose of the Stone are unknown, although it is possibly of Roman origin, and there has been interest and speculation about it since at least the 16th century. There are modern claims that it was formerly an object of veneration, or has some occult significance. These assertions however, are completely unsubstantiated.DescriptionThe present London Stone is only the upper portion of a once much larger object, as described below under History. The surviving portion is a block of oolitic limestone approximately 53\u00a0cm wide, 43\u00a0cm high, and 30\u00a0cm front to back (21 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 12\u00a0inches). A study in the 1960s indicated that the stone is Clipsham Limestone, a good-quality stone from Rutland transported to London for building purposes in both the Roman and medieval periods. More recently Kevin Hayward has suggested that it may be Bath stone, the stone most used for monuments and sculpture in early Roman London and in Saxon times.Since 1962 London Stone has been located on the north side of Cannon Street, opposite Cannon Street station, housed in an aperture in the wall of number 111 Cannon Street (London EC4N 5AR), surrounded by a decorative Portland stone fascia with an iron grille. Inside the building it is protected by a glass case. The stone and its surround, with the iron grille, were designated a Grade II* listed structure on 5 June 1972.","id":"110339149016905"},{"location":{"street":"23 Orchard Street","city":"London","state":"","country":"United Kingdom","zip":"W1H 6HL","latitude":51.514978888125,"longitude":-0.15427529811859},"name":"Hotel Chantelle London","likes":3669,"talking_about_count":1645,"were_here_count":2923,"description":"New York City\u2019s famed Hotel Chantelle, a multi-level restaurant and late night hot spot located in manhattan\u2019s lower east side, is excited to announce the launch of its new London location.
