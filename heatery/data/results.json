The Stinking Rose: A Garlic Restaurant.\\n\\nLocated in North Beach, San Francisco\\'s renowned Little Italy, the \\\"original\\\" Stinking Rose has become famous for celebrating the culinary euphoria of garlic and serving over 3,000 pounds of the pungent herb each month. Named after an historical term for \\\"garlic\\\", The Stinking Rose offers scrumptious, contemporary California-Italian cuisine prepared and adorned with garlic - and strives to accommodate every palate. There is hearty fare for the truly adventurous, mild for the novice, and sans garlic for those finding the herb\\'s folklore and aroma more appealing than its taste.\\n\\nAnd the fun goes far beyond the tantalizing choices at the table. Guests can enjoy treat-after-garlicky-treat in any of the restaurant\\'s whimsical dining rooms decorated with colorful garlic characters, curious memorabilia and a mechanical miniature garlic factory. The world\\'s largest garlic braid winds its way throughout the establishment, and festive murals, depicting a garlic bulb\\'s view of San Francisco\\'s history and culture, adorn the walls, The lovable bulbs, painted and brought to life by a local artist, can be found careening down the city\\'s steep hills on skateboards, running road races and picnicking at Golden Gate Park. Garlic-shaped fish can even be found swimming under Fisherman\\'s Wharf. At last count, 2,635 bulbs of garlic, two onions and one leek festooned every conceivable nook and cranny.\\n\\nSmall parties and large groups alike are welcome to enjoy the aromatic fare. Banquet facilities at The Stinking Rose accommodate 15 - 60 guests. Pre-set banquet menus are available. The chef is happy to customize banquet menus to serve customers\\' special needs.\\n\\nThe Stinking Rose also features an extensive selection of gift and food items for take home enjoyment.
